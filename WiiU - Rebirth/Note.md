## General   
This is meant to be used with Cafiine on a WiiU console. The two folders contain the same files, but one is for the US and the other for the EU version.

## Installation   
_To be added._

## Differences to PC Rebirth   
Most things seem to be the same. The only thing I noticed (that also gave me some trouble at first) is, that ```anm2root``` in the PCs ``` entities2.xml ```  is set to ```resouces/gfx/``` in rebirth.
For some reason the WiiU needs ```anm2root="gfx/"```, like the PCs Afterbirth version.
