# extrafw-adaption
This branch aims to rebuild agony to depend on [extrafw](https://github.com/AgonyTeam/ExtraFW) and maybe also alphaapi (?) instead of having the utility code tied to itself.
Currently all previous code is disabled and only new code is enabled (only Slicker atm).
[Extrafw](https://github.com/AgonyTeam/ExtraFW) needs to be also installed or else this version of Agony won't run.
