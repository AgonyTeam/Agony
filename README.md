##Information
###General
Welcome to The Agony of Isaac, a WIP mod for The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ !

The mod is currently playable, just download the repository, put it wherever your Afterbirth+ mod folder is and enjoy!

##Help Wanted
There's a lot of work to do, hopefully you can contribute and get your name in the credits!
Check out our project boards!

###Coding
- (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/1) Anything here that has the "APPROVED" tag has to be done, assign yourself and program away!  
- (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/2) Anything here with the "BUG" or "NEEDS CODE" tag needs some work, help us out!

###Art
- (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/2) Look for the "NEEDS SPRITE" or "NEEDS ANIMATION" tags! If you have any concept art post it on our idea board! (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/1)  

###Sound Design
- We don't need any sound design as of now. Someone is already working on a whole new track for Agony, but if you're good at music/sound design, show us what you can do and we'll most likely find a use for it!  

###Design
- We're always looking for new ideas, feel free to contribute here ! (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/1) Don't be shy, even if your idea is stupid, maybe it'll inspire someone else!  

####A note on Design:
- Identity
  - More than anything, identity is very important when it comes to enemy/item design, even if something is not unique, is there a way to make it feel special ? (Think how Death touch feels super cool eventhough it's only piercing shot + dmg up)
  - A strong identity doesn't mean the item has to be strong or bad, the butterbean has a great identity eventhough it sucks ass.
  - Theme, visual effects and sfx are really important here
 - Bad items aren't bad
  - It's important to have bad items, as long as they can somehow be useful in a specific situation
 - Random is fun but controlled randomness is more fun
  - Think how the Discover mechanic in Hearthstone is way more rewarding than gettign a random card
 - Go big or go home
  - When designing/modifying something don't change 5-10%, big cuts are way more effective when it comes to balancing, trust me!

###Testing
- Agony adds a lot of content. We can't test everything, feel free to report any bug you find! Make sure you leave enough info for us to reprodue the issue!  

###Misc
- Are you good at promoting stuff ? Then we need you, be it a video trailer, a montage, or even a Youtube let's play of the mod, it helps and we love you forever for it!  
- Bored ? Why not help us complete our wiki (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/wiki), just follow the template of alreayd existing pages!
