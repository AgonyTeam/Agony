## Information
### General
Welcome to The Agony of Isaac, a WIP mod for The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth† !

The mod is currently playable, just download the repository, put it wherever your Afterbirth† mod folder is and enjoy!

## Help Wanted
There's a lot of work to do, hopefully you can contribute and get your name in the credits!
Check out our project boards!

### Coding
- (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/1) Anything here that has the "APPROVED" tag has to be done, assign yourself and program away!  
- (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/2) Anything here with the "BUG" or "NEEDS CODE" tag needs some work, help us out!

### Art
- (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/2) Look for the "NEEDS SPRITE" or "NEEDS ANIMATION" tags! If you have any concept art post it on our idea board! (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/1)  

### Sound Design
- We don't need any sound design as of now. Someone is already working on a whole new track for Agony, but if you're good at music/sound design, show us what you can do and we'll most likely find a use for it!  

### Design
- We're always looking for new ideas, feel free to contribute here ! (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/projects/1) Don't be shy, even if your idea is stupid, maybe it'll inspire someone else!  

#### A note on Design:
- Identity
      - More than anything, identity is very important when it comes to enemy/item design, even if something is not unique, is there a way to make it feel special ? (Think how Death touch feels super cool eventhough it's only piercing shot + dmg up)
      - A strong identity doesn't mean the item has to be strong or bad, the butterbean has a great identity eventhough it sucks ass.
      - Theme, visual effects and sfx are really important here
- Bad items aren't bad
       - It's important to have bad items, as long as they can somehow be useful in a specific situation
- Random is fun but controlled randomness is more fun
       - Think how the Discover mechanic in Hearthstone is way more rewarding than getting a random card
- Go big or go home
       - When designing/modifying something don't change 5-10%, big cuts are way more effective when it comes to balancing, trust me!

### Testing
- Agony adds a lot of content. We can't test everything, feel free to report any bug you find! Make sure you leave enough info for us to reprodue the issue!  

### Misc
- Are you good at promoting stuff ? Then we need you, be it a video trailer, a montage, or even a Youtube let's play of the mod, it helps and we love you forever for it!  
- Bored ? Why not help us complete our wiki (https://github.com/AgonyTeam/Agony/wiki), just follow the template of alreayd existing pages!  


### How to use Github
- **0**: Get git. If you are on Windows or Mac, get "[Github Dektop](https://desktop.github.com/)", for linux just get "git" with `apt-get install`, if it isn't already installed by default.
- **1**: Fork the repo by pressing the button that says "_Fork_" on it. (In your browser)
- **2**: Clone your Fork to your Computer. For that open up "_Git Shell_" on Windows/Mac or a terminal window on Linux. In the command line you just opened, enter `git clone url`. Replace `url` with the link you get from clicking the green "_Clone or download_" button on github in your browser.
- **3**: In the command line, go into the folder that your repo was cloned into with the `cd path` command. (`path` being the path to the folder, on windows, just do `cd Agony` in our case). Make your changes.
- **4**: Once done making changes, go to the command line again and enter `git commit -a` to commit all changes. A text editor window will open, prompting you to enter a commit message. Enter a message describing what is changed and then save the file and exit the text window.
- **5**: Now do `git push`. Your changes should be live now.
- **6**: In the browser, go to the original repo and push the "_New pull request_" button. Now on the compare page, click "_compare across forks_" and select your fork as the "_head fork_". Add some title and description and last but not least press "_Create Pull Request_".
