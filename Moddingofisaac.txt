Linux Isaac is case sensitive, 
Running script to make everything lowercase fixes the issue. (Thanks to DashieGasai for the fix) 
find my_root_dir -depth -exec rename 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;

Clearly describe what happened, try to always [b]include screenshots[/b], [b]the seed[/b] as well as [b]the version of the mod you're using[/b]. Also be sure you followed the [b]Installation instructions[/b] correctly!

[b]Q: [/b]Do I have permission to use this mod in mine? 
[b]A: [/b]You can use Agony in your own mod as long as you follow these rules: 
-[b]Clearly state[/b] what Agony does in your mod's description 
-Provide [b]a link to Agony[/b] in your mod's description 
-Only redistribute [b]the files you modified[/b], this means you [b]can't include the new enemies sprites in your mod[/b]. 
As long as you follow these little rules, you're free to do whatever you want with Agony!  

[b]Q: [/b]Afterbirth? 
[b]A: [/b]We feature the Afterbirth [b]and[/b] the Rebirth version of our mod in the download. Be sure to install the correct one!

[b]Q: [/b]How do I uninstall the mod? 
[b]A: [/b]Just delete all files/folders [b]except the "packed" folder[/b] from the "resources" folder.

[b]Q: [/b]Does this work with [name of a mod]? 
[b]A: [/b]As long as [name of a mod] either explicitly states that it works with Agony or doesn't edit any files that Agony already edits, it should work.

[b]Q: [/b]Does this mod really [b]add[/b] new enemies or does it [b]replace[/b] existing ones? 
[b]A: [/b]This mod [b]doesn't[/b] replace anything. All mod content [b]coexists[/b] with the vanilla content.

[b]Q: [/b]I get a RAR file from the download. How do I open that? 
[b]A: [/b]You need to install [url=http://www.7-zip.org/]7-Zip[/url] or a similar program.

All feedback is greatly appreciated! If you think something is not right, please, feel free to leave a comment clearly explaining why. 
I recommend playing on [b]hard mode[/b] for all the content to show up properly! 
I [b]strongly[/b] recommend installing the mod [b]manually[/b], mod loaders have trouble installing this mod.

Drop the [b]"resources"[/b] folder for [b]the appropriate version[/b] into your game folder (%SteamRoot%\SteamApps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\) and you're good to go! I recommend using a [b]fresh, unmodded copy of the game[/b], make sure to always backup your game files!
